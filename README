Final Project- Learning Bayesian Networks
Matt Hink (mrh208)

1. ABSTRACT
  There exist several algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks from a given dataset.  In this project, I will compare the algorithmic efficiency of the common K2 algorithm to the A* search method described in [Yuan et al., 2011].

2. DOWNLOADING
  a. Using Git
    -The public readonly Git repository is available at 'git://github.com/hink1103/Learning-Bayesian-Networks.git'.
  b. Downloading as .zip

3. REQUIREMENTS
  -Developed using Ruby 1.9.2p290 on Xubuntu 11.10

4. INSTALLATION
  -This project uses the Bundler gem to manage its dependencies.  Bundler is available at 'http://gembundler.com'.
  -To install dependencies, issue 'bundle install' within the project root.

5. RUNNING
  -To run the main program on a selected set of datasets, run 'rake exec'.
