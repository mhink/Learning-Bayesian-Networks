Final Project- Learning Bayesian Networks
Matt Hink (mrh208)

1. REQUIREMENTS
  -Developed using eclipse with Sun Java 6 JRE on Windows 7
  -Also developed using openjdk-6-jre and ant 1.8.2-3 on Xubuntu 11.10

2. ABSTRACT
  There exist several algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks from a given dataset.  In this project, I will compare the algorithmic efficiency of the common K2 algorithm to the A* search method described in [Yuan et al., 2011].

3. DOWNLOADING
  a. Using Git
    -The public readonly Git repository is available at 'git://github.com/hink1103/Learning-Bayesian-Networks.git'.
  b. Downloading as .zip
    -A .zip archive of this project is available at 'https://github.com/hink1103/Learning-Bayesian-Networks/zipball/master'

4. INSTALLATION
  -Dependencies include:
    guava-libraries (http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/)
  -Please note that these dependencies are NOT INCLUDED BY DEFAULT. Ant must be connected to the Internet to fetch them.
  -To compile a fresh .jar from source, issue "ant" from the project root.

5. RUNNING
  -To execute the built .jar, issue "java -jar /dist/Learning-Bayesian-Networks*.jar" at the command line of a system with the Java 6 JRE installed.
