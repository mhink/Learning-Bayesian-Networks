Final Project- Learning Bayesian Networks
Matt Hink (mrh208)

1. ABSTRACT
  There exist several algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks from a given dataset.  In this project, I will compare the algorithmic efficiency of the common K2 algorithm to the A* search method described in [Yuan et al., 2011].
