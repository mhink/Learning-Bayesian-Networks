-NOTES AND FUN FACTS

-"Every edge on the search graph represents an optimal parent set for a variable." -Yuan
--This makes sense, because each successor chooses a certain variable and calculates the best parent set for that variable,
--given the variables that have been selected before it.

-"We define edge cost between two search nodes S1, S2 as BEST-MDL(X, S1), where X is the only variable in S2 \ S1"

--SO: there are actually two different uses of BEST-MDL at play here.
--ACTUAL edge cost, BEST-MDL( S2\S1, S1 )
--HEURISTIC cost, SUM over all BEST-MDLs for any X not already in the order graph.
